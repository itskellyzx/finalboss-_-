    <p id=text> There r so many works going on across here these days. I would like to be like Rome when I am an old lady…so I took myself on a two-hour walk through town today just want to look around. This is quite easy to do if you stop once or twice to fuel up on some good drinks. But there were so many pigeons on the street today (this is not a problem but a question)…and I actually really like pigeons. It's the seagulls who are the worst. I mean at least pigeons don't steal our food right?</p>
