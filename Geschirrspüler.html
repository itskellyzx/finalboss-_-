    <p id=text>Washing machine is not working for a long time. Though im getting used to wash all the stuff by hands but if the washing machine can run properly maybe it’s nice as well. (And also im not sure if I was the person who broke the machine? Cause Im the last person who use the machine before it broke down :( so maybe I have to take  the responsibility to fixxxx it!) but then Felix (my roommate) help me fix it up together (he’s done the 95% of the work)</p>
